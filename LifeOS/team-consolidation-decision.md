### Research Authorities Consulted

**Primary Authority**: Smart Friend Analysis (AI Senior Developer Consultant)
- **Expertise**: ADHD productivity systems, team organization psychology
- **Key Finding**: Single team with projects optimal for ADHD solopreneurs
- **Rationale**: Reduces context switching, decision fatigue, navigation complexity

**Supporting Research**: Exa Search (attempted - timeout occurred)
- **Query**: Linear team organization best practices, multiple vs single teams
- **Intended Focus**: Productivity impacts, collaboration efficiency, ADHD considerations

### Decision Rationale

#### Multiple Teams (Rejected)
- **Context Switching Overhead**: "Which team am I in?" decision fatigue
- **Fragmented Notifications**: Multiple inboxes to monitor
- **Navigation Complexity**: ADHD brains struggle with multi-team navigation
- **Over-Engineering Risk**: Time spent managing structure vs. shipping JusticeOS

#### Single Team with Projects (Accepted)
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: One inbox, one notification stream
- **ADHD-Friendly**: Simpler navigation, fewer decisions
- **Domain Separation Maintained**: Projects still organize work effectively
- **Faster Execution**: Less overhead, more time on revenue-generating activities
- **10% Time Cap Alignment**: Less structure management = more execution

### Implementation

**Structure**: Single EmpathyLabs team with domain-specific projects
- **LifeOS**: Personal productivity and life automation
- **WorkOS**: Professional execution and JusticeOS development
- **PrinciplesOS**: Operations, morals, decision-making factory
- **ACDC**: Autocatalytic Processes under PrinciplesOS oversight
- **LeBrain**: Memory MCP under PrinciplesOS oversight

**Updated Descriptions**: All project descriptions updated to reflect "ADHD-friendly structure" under single EmpathyLabs team.

### Expected Impact

- **Reduced Decision Fatigue**: Single team selection eliminates choice overhead
- **Unified Notification Stream**: All updates in one inbox
- **Preserved Domain Organization**: Projects maintain clear boundaries
- **Increased Execution Time**: Less structure management, more shipping
- **Better ADHD Alignment**: Simplified complexity supports focus
