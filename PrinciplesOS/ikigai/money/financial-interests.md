# Financial Interests & Revenue Priorities

## Core Question: Does this further my financial interests?

### 6am JusticeOS Deadline Priority
- [ ] Ship JusticeOS revenue features by 6am deadline
- [ ] Focus on cash-generating functionality
- [ ] Eliminate $500k debt through JusticeOS success
- [ ] Prioritize features that can generate immediate revenue

### Revenue-Generating Activities
- [ ] JusticeOS client onboarding completion
- [ ] Billing system implementation
- [ ] Payment processing integration
- [ ] Feature completion for market launch

### Debt Elimination Strategies
- [ ] JusticeOS MVP launch for initial revenue
- [ ] Client acquisition and retention
- [ ] Subscription model optimization
- [ ] Cost reduction and efficiency improvements

### Financial Decision Framework
- **Immediate ROI**: Does this generate cash this week?
- **Deadline Alignment**: Does this support 6am JusticeOS launch?
- **Debt Impact**: Does this reduce $500k debt burden?
- **Revenue Priority**: Is this higher priority than meta-systems?

## Money-First Decision Rule
If activity doesn't directly support JusticeOS revenue or 6am deadline, defer until debt is cleared.
